        <h1><center>Welcome to our first Shiny application !</center></h1>
        </br>
        <p>This application was developped by Wael B.H.Y and Dorian HERVE as the final project of the "Tidyverse&Shiny" part of our TER course.</p>
        <p>The data used in our visualizations comes from Ulule's oficial website. As a crowdfunding pioneer since 2010, Ulule has become the leading community-backed incubator of positive impact projects.</p>
        <center><img src="ulule.png" alt="" width=400/></center>
        <p>The data is comprised of more than 40 000 projects presented on Ulule. These projects originate from numerous countries/continents, and are relevant to a wide array of fields.</p>
        </br>
        <p>You can find 3 different visualisations on our application that will help you extract potentially crucial information for your own analysis :</p>
        <p>The number of created campaigns.</p>
        <p>The percentage of completed campaigns.</p>
        <p>The average sum raised (in EUR) by the campaigns.</p> </br>
        <p>All of the above graphs showcase the desired results by distinguishing the months of debut of said projects. The user also has the option to filter the results by year of project debut, as well as project category, thus allowing him to visualize the "percentage of completed campaigns for Game-related projects that were launched in Jan-Dec 2015" for example.</p>
